# WEB Application InDriver
## The entire app is inspired by the "InDriver" app (link:https://indriver.com/ru/city)
### InDriver works on the model of quick deals, and the passenger and the driver manage the main parameters of the trip themselves: the passenger specifies the price he is willing to pay for the trip, the drivers receive the application. They can either accept this offer or set their own price.
